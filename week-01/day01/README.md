# Week 1 > Day 01

1. created a **bash script** to generate directories and README files for every day of this week.

 > this was my first real bash script! also had to figure out how to set up `.bash_profile` and `.zshrc` to play nicely, allowing global (?) running of this script from `~/bin`. the script currently lives there. made a duplicate of this file and put it in the local day01 'extras' directory as well.

2. used terminal commands to **add directories and files for the basic webpage assignment**

3. uploaded **screenshots** of the tree & the bash script to http://imgur.com/a/KH62G . also added these screenshots to 'extras'

4. started doing this here **markdown assignment**

5. next up: **basic webpage**. created using some colors and an image from an old site.

6. **on surge at http://ce-w01-d01.surge.sh**
