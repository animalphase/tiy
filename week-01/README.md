# TIY front-end, Week 1
## Weekly refelction

First week of class! I am really excited to go through this program. Everything seemed to fall together in my life to pull me here.

I've been wanting to strengthen my foundational programming knowledge for a long time, and found myself looking for the next opportunity just as this front-end course was starting. This is the most direct jump across into technical work for me, but I want to keep growing and learning new things!

The class is composed of a good group of folks, who have all been great to get along with so far. I have come from a background working with some  and I have found them great to get along with.

I do still wonder about coming out to people—I have done nothing but be open around folks, and it has been comfortable and fine. The groups is somewhat mixed on being able to pick up these things, though… it should all work out in time with some extra effort though.

But I have also have had good discussions and boding with other folks.

### New technical things to me this week:

I have a background working in HTML & CSS (roughly), so I wasn't sure how many new things I would be learning in the first week of class. It was great, because we started off with a lot more than just

#### Terminal
We set up our computers with lots of useful addons/etc, like Zsh and Tree, to make Terminal faster & more convenient to use.

I have only barely used Terminal before, but now I'm getting comfortable navigating around, making files and directories, using developer tools, etc. Used Surge for the first time to post projects online!

#### Bash Scripting
As part of the extra work a bit about how Bash scripts work on OSX, and wrote my first one! It was a simple loop to generate a new folder for each day of the week, as well as populate each day's folder with subfolders and a README.md.

This was the most challenging thing I faced this week. I have some experience scripting and was comfortable writing the requisite loop, but had no idea how bash scripting work (and definitely didn't want to mess up my file system).

I also wanted to make sure the script ran globally from my ~/bin folder, so needed updated my bash config file, but it also turned out that Zsh's config was preventing the standard bash config from loading, so I had to enable it there. These were all things that I was unaware of before this day, so it was a fun thing to dig around in and learn!

#### Basic webpage exercises
This was a good chance to review some foundational HTML knowledge, and to learn more about the details for form properties and the like.

In CSS, I learned enough about flexboxes to write them manually, and am finding out about their peculiarities!
